How to install this package:
============================

One way is to wave a copy of the .sty file in the same directory as the .tex files that use this package. Alternatively, you can save the .sty file to your texmf folder (see this tex.stackexchange post for details: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-tex-files)

To tell LaTeX you want to use this package, just write
\usepackage{homework}
in the preamble of your .tex file.
